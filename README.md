# Assignment 1


For the first assignment, you are going to create two responsive layouts for a note-taking website. (We'll add JS to this website in the second assignment)

## Instructions:

Initialize a local repository and create one HTML page and one CSS file (saved in a separate folder). As usual, do your development in separate branches and merge back to the main branch when you're done. 

* Make sure the colors you use pass the contrast check (provide screenshot of your check)  https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ **1 point**
* Include a Google font **1 points**
* Make use of CSS Grid and Flexbox to position elements (Try to make your layouts as close as possible to how it shows in the screenshot) **5 points**
  * The content should take all the available viewportâ€™s height. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length)
    *  The sidebar on the left should take 1/5 of the page width, and the rest of the page should be flexibly resized.
    *  Your HTML page should include all the components shown in the screenshot.
    *  Make the logos in the footer clickable.
